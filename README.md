**Milestone 2 with GUI**
    This folder is dedicated to the game between 2 computers with a server as a main point of communication between the users. This milestone was implemented with GUI directly. The files included are myClient.py and myServer.py Done by Mateo Nuñez who focused mainly on the client side and the GUI and Craig Walkup who focused on the server side.

**Milestone 3**
    This folder is dedicated to the program that merges and implements the previous milestones with a server that allows multiple connections. The clients can play offline, online, through a server, or peer-to-peer. The files included are server.py and ttt.py Done by Jonathan Wheeler
